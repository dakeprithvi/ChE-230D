# Hybrid Modelling for Chemical Plants

This project is specifically aimed at model identification applied to chemical plants. Here, we present a simplified 'hybrid' modelling approach using neural networks to represent the difficult-to-model parts in the first-principles implementation. The methodology is inspired by the work of Kumar and Rawlings (2023), and we further expand the concept with quantile regression to make the model selectively learn a certain quantile of the data. This approach enhances the model's ability for uncertainty prediction, providing a more robust framework for chemical plant modeling.
